# IEEE TechLoop+ ML: Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the world of Machine Learning! This repository contains the compiled materials of previous TechLoop+ ML sessions. The sessions are interactive workshops designed for beginners: we cover core concepts, the math behind common models, and hands-on notebooks that build and evaluate ML models.

### OVERVIEW
This repo collects teaching materials and example notebooks used in TechLoop+ ML workshops. It is intended as a learning resource for newcomers to ML who want to follow guided examples, inspect datasets, and run the notebooks locally.

### REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- `TechLoop2026/` — 
- `TechLoop2025/` — Workshop materials and datasets from 2025. The session highlighted the three primary paradigms of machine learning, how to perform essential data analysis and visualization, the intuition and mathematics behind predictive modeling, the building blocks of deep learning through a practical image classification project.
