# IEEE TechLoop+ ML: Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the world of Machine Learning! This repository contains the compiled materials of previous TechLoop+ ML sessions. The sessions are interactive workshops designed for beginners: we cover core concepts, the math behind common models, and hands-on notebooks that build and evaluate ML models.

### OVERVIEW
This repo collects teaching materials and example notebooks used in TechLoop+ ML workshops. It is intended as a learning resource for newcomers to ML who want to follow guided examples, inspect datasets, and run the notebooks locally.

### REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
- `TechLoop2026/` — Workshop materials and notes from 2026. This session covered PyTorch and Machine Learning fundamentals and the core workflow of training neural networks, how models work under the hood and how ML is powering everything, building intuition for tensors, model architecture, loss functions, optimization, and evaluation. We then applied these concepts in a hands-on MNIST handwritten digit classification project, training an MLP classifier, tracking loss/accuracy curves, and exporting the trained model.
- `TechLoop2025/` — Workshop materials and datasets from 2025. The session highlighted the three primary paradigms of machine learning, how to perform essential data analysis and visualization, the intuition and mathematics behind predictive modeling, the building blocks of deep learning through a practical image classification project.
